# Ignoring return value of useEffect Hook in React
This example demonstrates a common warning in React applications related to ignoring the return value of the `useEffect` hook.  The warning itself is not always indicative of a bug, but it signals a potential performance issue or memory leak if not handled correctly.

## The Problem
The provided `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` without properly handling its return value.  The return value from `useEffect` is a cleanup function.  If the cleanup function is not returned and the component unmounts, it won't cleanup actions such as subscriptions, timers, or event listeners, which could lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## The Solution
The solution involves ensuring that a cleanup function is properly used in the return statement of useEffect, or, if no cleanup is necessary, remove the return statement. This ensures that any resources acquired during the component's mount phase are released when the component is unmounted.
